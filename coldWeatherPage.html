        <p>
            <strong>Eugene/Springfield Adults and Unaccompanied Youth:</strong>
            If temperatures are expected to drop below 30 degrees, 
            <a href="https://www.svdp.us/services/shelter-assistance/egan-warming-centers/" title="egan warming center">Egan Warming Center</a>
            Center will be activated to offer a secure 
            refuge from the cold weather. Since there isn't a central 
            gathering spot this year, it's essential to check the warming 
            center locations for every activation. You can enroll online to 
            receive alerts about Egan activation.
